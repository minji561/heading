<strong>Violet Parr</strong> is a 14-year-old junior high school teenager stuck at the crossroads between girl and woman.
Violet desperately wants to be like everyone else, to blend in with normal people, and not to stand out.
Her superpowers allow her to turn instantly invisible, and to generate spherical force fields to protect herself and also to levitate extremely heavy objects.
During the first film, she and Dash combine their powers to create the IncrediBall, a tactic in which Violet generates a force field around herself, and Dash uses his speed power to use the ball like a cannonball or battering ram.
