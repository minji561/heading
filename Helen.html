<strong>Helen Parr(a.k.a <strong>Elastigirl</strong> or <strong>Mrs.Incredible</strong>)</strong> can stretch any part of her body up to 300 feet and can be 1mm thin.
She can also reshape her body in a variety of ways. In the movie she becomes a parachute and a rubber boat, and has used her arms for swings and a slingshot.
In hear early years, she seemed to be a feminist and had no desire to "settle down".
Since her marriage to Bob, Helen has become a dedicated spouse and mother, although she is frustrated with her husband's continuing dreams of glory.
Her red superheroine suit, designed by Edna Mode, can stretch as far as she can and still retain its shape. It is virtually indestructible yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.
